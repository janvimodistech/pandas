Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding, that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input, and others involve natural language generation.

NLP can be used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how human language works. This includes tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and more. NLP techniques are widely used in applications like virtual assistants, chatbots, search engines, and language translation services.
